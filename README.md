Flight Computer bootloader developed for the [SAMRH71](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/SAMRH71) and [SAMV71](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATSAMV71Q21).

## Build

### Dependencies

*Note: Currently the development environment is Linux only.*

- Python 3
- TODO: ARM tool chain
- make
- opneocd

### Configuration

To support multiple targets and various configurations (development / debug / production) this project uses Kconfig. To configure the build for a specific board:

```bash
$ make <board>_defconfig
```

Currently supported targets:

- [Atmel SAMRH71](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/SAMRH71)
	+ `samrh71_ek_defconfig` : [SAMRH71F20-EK](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/PartNO/SAMRH71F20-EK)
- [Atmel SAMV71Q21](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATSAMV71Q21)
	+ `samv71_xult_ek_defconfig` : [SAM V71 Xplained Ultra](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/PartNO/ATSAMV71-XULT)

### Compile

```bash
$ make
```

This will generate `bin/bootloader.elf`.

### Deploy

The method of loading the binary onto the target depends on the specific board and debug connection. Below are examples for the two evaluation boards.

#### SAMV71 Xplained Ultra

This example uses `gdb` to load code via `openocd` over the eDBG interface.

```bash
# In one terminal (tab)
$ openocd -f interface/cmsis-dap.cfg -f board/atmel_samv71_xplained_ultra.cfg

# In another terminal (tab)
$ arm-none-eabi-gdb bin/bootloader.elf
(gdb) tar ext :3333
(gdb) load
(gdb) quit
```

#### SAMRH71 EK

## README TODO

- RH71 deploy example
	+ Supporting the Atmel ICE
	+ Custom openocd config file
- Debug notes
	+ Supporting the Atmel ICE with V71 (selecting USB device)
- Fill out sections: Project Structure, Contributing, ...

Old config (removing this soon).

## Requirements

* Python 3
* Usb or debugger connection to either the ATSAMV71 Xplained board, or the ATSAMV71RH Eval board

## Setup

```bash
pip3 install tools/requirements.txt
sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-none-eabi
sudo apt install openocd gdb-multiarch
```

## How do I use it?

git and make


## Configuration


### Compiler

something arm eabi some version


### Makefile

clean
	make clean

config file for ATSAMV71 Xplained board
	make samv71_xult_ek_defconfig
or
config file for ATSAMV71RH Eval board
	make samrh71_ek_defconfig

build:
	make

start openocd server thing:
	openocd -f interface/cmsis-dap.cfg -f board/atmel_samv71_xplained_ultra.cfg

separate terminal:
	gdb-multiarch bin/bootloader.elf

separate terminal:
	#here goes python terminal startup
