Flight Computer bootloader developed for the [SAMRH71](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/SAMRH71) and [SAMV71](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATSAMV71Q21).

## Build

### Dependencies

*Note: Currently the development environment is Linux only.*

- Python 3 (see tools/requirements.txt)
- ARM tool chain (version used during development: `arm-none-eabi-gcc (GNU Tools for Arm Embedded Processors 7-2017-q4-major) 7.2.1 20170904 (release) [ARM/embedded-7-branch revision 255204]`)
- [meson](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/)
- opneocd

### Configuration

To support multiple targets and various configurations (development / debug / production) this project uses Kconfig. To configure the build for a specific board:

```bash
# <board> = (e.g.) samv71_xult_ek or samrh71_ek
$ meson <build-dir> --cross-file tools/meson/gcc-arm-cortex-m7.txt -Dboard=<board>
```

Currently supported targets:

- [Atmel SAMRH71](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/SAMRH71)
	+ `samrh71_ek` : [SAMRH71F20-EK](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/PartNO/SAMRH71F20-EK)
- [Atmel SAMV71Q21](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATSAMV71Q21)
	+ `samv71_xult_ek` : [SAM V71 Xplained Ultra](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/PartNO/ATSAMV71-XULT)

### Compile

```bash
$ ninja -C <build-dir>
# or
$ cd <build-dir>
$ ninja
```

This will generate `bin/bootloader.elf`.

### Deploy

The method of loading the binary onto the target depends on the specific board and debug connection. Below are examples for the two evaluation boards.

#### SAMV71 Xplained Ultra

This example uses `gdb` to load code via `openocd` over the eDBG interface.

```bash
# In one terminal (tab)
$ openocd -f interface/cmsis-dap.cfg -f board/atmel_samv71_xplained_ultra.cfg

# In another terminal (tab)
$ arm-none-eabi-gdb bin/bootloader.elf
(gdb) tar ext :3333
(gdb) load
(gdb) quit
```
